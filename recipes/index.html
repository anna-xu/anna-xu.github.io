<h1>Food Recipes</h1>

Archive of recipes I want to remember; click on the link for the recipe. This will likely include different cuisines, but most (if not all) recipes will have spicier options. I usually don't measure my ingredients precisely, so there will just be estimates of what I throw together. Unlinked food recipes will be linked once the recipe has been written; photos of foods to be posted on the link later.
